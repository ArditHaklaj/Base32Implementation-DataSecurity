# Base32Implementation-DataSecurity

Our team utilized both our expertise and existing source code to complete this project assigned by 
our professor from the University of Pristina.

# Usage

The project involves the implementation of the base32 method for encoding characters and texts. 
To run the file in Python, you only need to have Python configured on your device and the necessary 
libraries required for the implementation.

# Language

Python is the programming language that we are most familiar with, but that does not imply that
other languages cannot be used for implementation. The code we have used is open source and has 
been implemented by others in the past. We have only made modifications to it to suit our 
requirements. If anyone encounters any issues with it, they are welcome to reach out to us for assistance.
